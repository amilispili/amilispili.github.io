# Portfolio Site

It's time to build out your final portfolio! Use this time to research, design,
and built your personal website.

Your portfolio site is an important part of your personal brand and any job
applications you send out. It'll often the first thing hiring managers look at
in your application, so it's pretty important to have a clean and professional
looking portfolio site!

Start by reading through the following:

* [Building A Portfolio Site](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-lessons/building-a-portfolio-site)
* [15 Web Developer Portfolios to Inspire You](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/15-web-developer-portfolios-to-inspire-you-137fb1743cae)
* [10 Awesome Web Developer Portfolios](https://codeburst.io/10-awesome-web-developer-portfolios-d266b32e6154)

Once you've finished, go ahead and get started researching, planning and
building your portfolio site. You are free to build off of the portfolio site
you started in Week 1 or scrap it and start from scratch!

## Instructions

1. Research developer portfolio sites and post an issue on this repository with
   three or so websites you'll model your own off of.
1. Come up with a design direction for your own portfolio site.
1. Create a new repository under your GitHub account (not GitHub Enterprise).
1. Build your portfolio site.
1. Deploy your portfolio site.
1. Update your issue on this repository with the link to your deployed portfolio
   site and it's repository.

**Be sure to create a new repository on GitHub, not GitHub Enterprise!**

## Requirements

Your portfolio site can be built with any technology. Plain HTML, CSS and
JavaScript work great. If you want something a little more advanced, consider
a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby.

Your portfolio site must be deployed to be considered complete. It also must
include your first and last name, a link to your GitHub account, a link to
download your resume, and a link to each of your 4 projects.

It can optionally include your email and/or phone number. Note that putting
contact information on the web like that can have possible negative
repercussions - you could start receiving spam emails or calls and/or calls from
recruiters out of the blue.

Having an image or screenshot of your projects with a description is a great way
to showcase your projects.

Ask your instructors to see what their portfolio sites look like!
